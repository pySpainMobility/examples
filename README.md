# Examples 

In this repository, we collected some Jupyter Notebooks containing basic examples on how to use `pySpainMobility` 

Here is a short description on what each notebook contains: 

- `00-weekend-vs-weekdays.ipynb` download an example of 1 week of data and split them into weekend and weekdays OD matrices. Also, each origin and destination is mapped with its centroid
- `01-madrid.ipynb` download data as GUA level for 1 week, extract the data for Madrid and plot them into a time serie
- `02-flow-madrid-barcelona.ipynb` extract the flows between Madrid and Barcelona
- `03-socio-demographic-disaggregation.ipynb` disaggregate mobility flows with respect to age bins and other socio-demographic factors
- `04-paper.ipynb` reproduce some of the figures in the paper
